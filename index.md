Third year mechanical engineering student at UC Riverside interested in thermal systems, energy optimization, and how heat moves through complex systems.

## interests


My work focuses on thermal management and energy systems, particularly in applications where optimization creates meaningful efficiency gains or health benefits. I'm drawn to work that sits at the intersection of design, simulation, and hands-on problem solving. I particularly enjoy problems with sequential dependencies, where solving one constraint unlocks the next. I love thinking through system architectures and understanding inputs/outputs until execution becomes straightforward.

**Highlander Racing** — Lead the cooling subteam where I developed a MATLAB thermal simulation for our liquid cooling loop and scaled the team from 2 to 11 members.

**Utthunga Internship** — Worked on thermal simulations for electronic enclosures and built Python-based diagnostic tools for pump systems and heat exchanger analysis.

## personal projects

**Cycling Route Planner**: Using personal Strava data to optimize for air quality and shade coverage rather than speed. Most routing tools prioritize time efficiency, but riding through Riverside's industrial corridors has health tradeoffs worth avoiding.

**Home Energy Dashboard**: Models HVAC loads, solar generation, and EV charging to identify system-level optimization opportunities.
